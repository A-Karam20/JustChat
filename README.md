Here are the steps to follow when using this application:

Make sure the IP address is set as the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on both the server and client side.
Check that the port is correctly configured on both the server and client.
Please note that the appearance of some components may vary depending on the PC's settings as it is built with Windows Forms.
Start by launching the server application, followed by the client application.
All credentials, contacts, and messages are stored in CSV files on the server side.
To access these files, navigate to the bin\Debug\net6.0 directory on the server side.
If the files do not exist yet, they will be created once you launch the application and interact with it.
